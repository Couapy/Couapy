## My story

Since childhood, I have been interested in technologies, and more particularly: Internet.
When I was in college, I set up my first site, then I wanted to code it by myself.

## My skills

Now, that is to say years later, I master many languages such as: HTML, PHP 🐘, Python 🐍, CSS and Javascript.

And tools like: Django, Bootstrap, Git / Github and Linux 🐧

## My projects

Here on my github you can see all the projects that I have participated in that have allowed me to obtain the above skills.
We're always learning, so the list of my projects will never end :)
