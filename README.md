👋 Hello there !

My name is Maël and I am a web developer. 💻

## My story

Since childhood, I have been interested in technologies, and more particularly: Internet.
When I was in college, I set up my first site, then I wanted to code it by myself.

Now, that is to say years later, I master many languages such as:

- HTML
- PHP
- Python
- CSS
- Javascript

And tools like:

- Django
- Bootstrap
- Git / Github
- Linux 🐧

## My projects

We're always learning, so the list of my projects will never end :)
