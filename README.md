# Maël

👋 Hello there !

My name is Maël and I am a software engineer student. 💻

## My story

Since childhood, I have been interested in technologies, and more particularly Internet.
When I was at middle school, I set up my first site, then I wanted to code it by myself.

Currently I am a software engineer student at the @UTT (University of Technology of Troyes) specialized in Informatic and Information Systems.

## My stack

Now, that is to say years later, I master many languages such as: Python (Django) 🐍, JavaScript, Java ☕, HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap.

To execute my applications on my personal server, I use Docker 🚢.

Of course, I master git / GitHub, and other tools like linux (archlinux on my main PC).

## My projects

All my projects are open-sourced, so you can check all my code !

Just for you, I pinned my favorite projects below (don't hesitate to check it and send me your feedback by mail).
